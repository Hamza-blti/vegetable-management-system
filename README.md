# vegetable-management-system

## Overview

The Vegetable Management System is a simple console-based application written in C++. It allows users to manage their vegetable orders through three different implementations: using simple variables, arrays, and pointers. Users can add items to their cart, view the menu, edit their cart, search for items, and more.

## Features

- **Three Implementations:** Choose from three different ways to manage vegetable orders - using simple variables, arrays, or pointers.
- **Cart Operations:** Add items to the cart, view the menu, edit the cart, search for items, and empty the cart.
- **Menu Display:** Display the vegetable menu with details such as name, price per kilogram, and shelf life.

## How to Run

1. Compile the C++ program using a suitable compiler (e.g., g++).
2. Run the executable file.
3. Follow on-screen instructions to navigate through different implementations and perform various operations.

## Usage Instructions

- To select the implementation, enter 'p' for pointers, 'a' for arrays, and 's' for simple variables.
- Follow the menu options for ordering, viewing, editing, and searching items in your cart.
- Enter '0' to exit or to finish ordering.

## Files

- `main.cpp`: Contains the main code for the Vegetable Management System.
- `cart_Pointers.txt`, `cart_Arrays.txt`, `cart_Simple.txt`: Files storing cart information for different implementations.
- `f1.txt`, `f2.txt`: Temporary files used in the edit functionality.
